                <p>In volleyball, the opposite hitter plays a crucial role on the court. While the opposite is in the back row they need to defend from back right (Position 1), and then transition into hitting 3D. This is an attack that is similar to the pipe, where you have to jump from behind the 3 meter line, but instead of from the middle of the court you hit from the right side. Positioned opposite the setter, the opposite provides offensive options when the setter is in the front row. While in the front court the opposite plays at front right (Postion 2) and blocks the opponentâ€™s outside hitter, contributing significantly to defense. They also attack from the right side. They need to be versatile, as they often hit from both the front and back row. </p>
