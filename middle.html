                <p>The middle blockerâ€™s job on the volleyball court is to control the net by blocking quick attacks and running fast offensive plays. They need to move quickly, read the setter, and work with the outside and right-side blockers to form a strong defense.
                    The middle blocker plays 1 rotation in the back court, this is when they serve and then they play in back left (Position 5), covering short tips and cross-court hits. When in the front court the middle plays at front middle (Position 3), blocking all attacks from the opposing team and running a quick attack with the setter. After the middle serves, they then sub off for the libero until the libero rotates back to the front row. As we can see in the diagram, the middle moves from blocking the opposing outside hitter, to hitting an A quick with the setter. This is shown by the arrows.</p>
