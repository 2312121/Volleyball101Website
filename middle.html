                <p>The middle blocker’s job on the volleyball court is to control the net by blocking quick attacks and running fast offensive plays. They need to move quickly, read the setter, and work with the outside and right-side blockers to form a strong defense.
                    In Rotation 1, the middle blocker serves and then plays in back left (Position 5), covering short tips and cross-court hits. In Rotation 2, they move to front left (Position 4), focusing on blocking the opponent’s right-side hitter. In Rotation 3, they are in front middle (Position 3), blocking quick sets and attacking fast balls. In Rotation 4, they start front right (Position 2), and move to front middle, blocking quicks and helping block against the opponent’s outside and opposite hitter. In Rotation 5, they are in back right (Position 1) serving, after they serve they covertips and defend the cross court angle. They then sub off for the libero until the libero rotate back to the front row.</p>
