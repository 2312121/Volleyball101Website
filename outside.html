                <p>The oustides job on the volleyball court is to hit the ball from the left side and pass well off serve recieve and off attacks from the net. They have to be able to pass, block, and hit.
                When the outside hitter is in the front court, they play at front left (Position 4). They need to block effectively and then transition quickly to attack. In the back court they will play at back middle (position 6). You need to make sure you stay deep while playing defence, nearly on the baseline. This is so that you can pick up all deep attacks or anything off the block. As we can see in the diagram, while the outside is playing front court (red dot), if the opposing team set the opposing outside hitter, you will usually not have time to set up a triple block. Instead you play at position 4 to cover a sharp cross court angle and/or if it goes off the block or along the net. This is a very important position defensively. Also this allows you to transition quickly to attack (as show with the arrows).</p>
