                In Rotation 1, the outside hitter will start in the front right (Position 6) and move to front left (position 4). The OH's primary responsibility here is to block effectively and then transition quickly to defense. After serving, the OH should move into a strong defensive position, usually covering deep cross-court attacks or preparing for a block against the opponentâ€™s outside hitter. Defensively, the OH will often be responsible for digging attacks from the opponent's outside hitter and right-side hitter.
