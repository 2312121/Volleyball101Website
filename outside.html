                <p>The oustides job on the volleyball court is to hit the ball from the left side and pass well off serve recieve and off attacks from the net. They have to be able to pass, block, and hit to be a good outside.
                In Rotation 1, the outside hitter will start in the front right (Position 2) and move to front left (position 4). The OH's primary responsibility while in the front court is to block effectively and then transition quickly to attack. Defensively, the OH will often be responsible for digging attacks from the opponent's outside hitter and right-side hitter. You need to make sure you stay deep while playing defence, nearly on the baseline. This is so that you can pick up all deep attacks or anything off the block. Outside is one of the hardest positions in volleyball, but it is extremely rewarding.</p>
