                <p>The setter’s job on the volleyball court is to run the offense by delivering accurate sets to hitters and making smart decisions under pressure. They need to communicate constantly, move quickly to the ball, and disguise their sets to keep the opponents guessing.
                    In Rotation 1, the setter starts in back right (Position 1), preparing to set from the right side of the court. In Rotation 2, they are in back middle (Position 6), quickly moving to the net to set. In Rotation 3, they are in back left (Position 5), again transitioning to the front right to set. In Rotation 4, they are in front left (Position 4), staying ready to block while still focusing on setting. In Rotation 5, they play in front middle (Position 3), helping block and then setting. In Rotation 6, they are in front right (Position 2), their natural setting spot, where they run the offense and block the opponent’s outside hitter.</p>
