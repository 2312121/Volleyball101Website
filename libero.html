                <p>A libero is a defensive specialist in volleyball who wears a different-colored jersey and plays only in the back row. Their main job is to receive serves and dig attacks, helping keep the ball in play and setting up the offense. Liberos are not allowed to serve, spike, or block, and they can’t rotate to the front row. They’re usually the team’s best passer and are constantly involved in defensive coverage and ball control. With quick reflexes and strong communication, the libero helps organize the back row and plays a key role in the team's overall defense.</p>
