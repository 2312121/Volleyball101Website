                <p>A libero is a defensive specialist in volleyball who wears a different-colored jersey and plays only in the back row. Their main job is to receive serves and dig attacks, helping keep the ball in play and setting up the offense. Liberos will usually play at back left (Position 5), covering their spikers when they go up to hit and covering tips from the opposing spikers. They only play in the back court, and are not allowed to serve, spike, or block. They’re usually the team’s best passer and are constantly involved in defensive coverage and ball control. With quick reflexes and strong communication, the libero helps organize the back row and plays a key role in the team's overall defense. As we can see in the diagram, the libero is the red dot and they are defending the opposing outside's attack. After the ball has been dug, they transition to cover the spikers in case they get blocked. This is shown by the arrow. </p>
